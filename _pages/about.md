This is the start of my academic website! I am just starting to wrap up my Junior year at Virginia Tech studying in the Computer engineering program. It has been a fun ride so far with developing myself as an engineer. As time goes on, I will continue to update this site with more information in my academic career.

**About Me**
A little bit about me is that I like to learn as much as I can. I feel that having a broad understanding of many topics can always benefit you. I think its great to be able to have so many opportunities at VT, with the multitude of classes and amazing faculty it makes it much more accessible to get a quality education.
